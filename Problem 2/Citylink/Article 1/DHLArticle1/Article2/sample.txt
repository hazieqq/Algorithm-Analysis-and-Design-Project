KUALA LUMPUR: From "door-to-door" and "in just three days" services, DHL Express successfully delivered the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines to Malaysia today. 
The express service provider worked with Malaysia Aviation Group's cargo subsidiary, MABkargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo) to fly the vaccines in and subsequently arranged for them to be sent directly to designated facilities across Kuala Lumpur.
"In the past year, our teams across the world have truly embodied the 'As One' spirit, coming together to deliver personal protective equipment, medical necessities, and daily essentials to communities in need.
 

"We have now come full circle to elevate our purpose of connecting people and improving lives with the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccines to countries everywhere including the very first of shipments to the Middle East, and now to Malaysia," said DHL Express Asia Pacific's Chief Executive Officer Ken Lee.
He said the company is proud to have the opportunity to make a difference, assuring that no effort is spared in ensuring that DHL Medical Express solution adheres to the stringent requirements of speed, quality, security, and reliability when it comes to transporting precious cargo.
One of the key challenges faced in the shipment of the Covid-19 vaccine, DHL said is the stringent temperature requirements.
The courier service informed that the vaccines were delivered in specially-designed thermal shipper packaging customised by the manufacturer. 
Each shipment was packed with dry ice to regulate the temperature, enabling its use in locations that lack the physical infrastructure to otherwise maintain the required temperature.
 

Temperature trackers equipped with sophisticated GPS technology are also packed within each thermal shipper box to provide full visibility throughout the shipment's entire journey, DHL said.
Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei Julian Neo said as Covid-19 continues to devastate lives and livelihoods, the vaccines represent hope for a better 2021.
"Organising their distribution to so many people in such a short time will be an extremely complex operation that we are well-equipped and proud to contribute to. 
"Since the onset of the pandemic, DHL Express has leveraged our broad experience and expertise to help maintain the integrity of the healthcare supply chain, ensuring vital supplies and protective equipment reach communities and medical stakeholders in need", he said.
Earlier this morning, the first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccines arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), transported by MABkargo Sdn Bhd (MASKargo) via flight MH604.
A total of 312,390 vaccine doses were flown on a Passenger-to-Cargo (P2C) flight using an Airbus 330-300 aircraft that touched down at 10.07am.
