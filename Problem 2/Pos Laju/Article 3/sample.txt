PETALING JAYA: Pos Malaysia says it is looking into a complaint that a postman had injured a dogs eye by shooting at it with a slingshot from across a house gate.
Pos Malaysia is investigating the incident and will take appropriate action against the postman if found guilty, a Pos Malaysia spokesperson told FMT.
In a 21-second CCTV video posted on the Malaysia Independent Animal Rescue Facebook page earlier today, a man in a Pos Malaysia uniform is seen on a motorcycle looking at a dog which is inside its owners compound.
He then uses what appears to be a slingshot to fire a projectile towards the dog, which then scurries away. The Facebook post states the dogs left eye is injured. The incident allegedly happened in Kluang, Johor, today.
An animal rights group called the incident utterly shocking and disturbing and urged Pos Malaysia to apologise to the affected family and punish the perpetrator.
Rajesh Nagarajan of the Lawyers for Animal Rights said the dog owner had stated that he would lodge a police report. He said Pos Malaysia must also lodge a police report to ensure that the culprit is charged.
